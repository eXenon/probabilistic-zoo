# Probabilistic Data Structure Zoo

A small exercise in clojure to implement probabilistic data structures.

### Bloom Filter

Determine wether an element is part of a set. Return values are either:
- Definitely NOT part of set
- Maybe part of set


### Count-Min Sketch

Counts the number of occurrences of an element in a set. The return value is guaranteed to be higher than the real value.
